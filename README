Template AngularJS Webapp using WebJars
=======================================

AngularJS files in app/assets/app
AngularJS controller communicates with Scala controller via routing
Makes developing REST APIs easy as cake
Decouples views from Play controller even further
You could even go so far as to remove the unidirectional Play bindings entirely

If IntelliJ Scala plugin throws syntax errors:
1. Close IntelliJ
2. Delete .idea folder and *.iml files
3. In project root run `sbt idea`
4. Syntax errors should be gone
